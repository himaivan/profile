The idea of creating an artificial machine that can think, act, and solve problems has captivated humans for centuries. From the 1950s until the 1990s, many scientists and mathematicians explored the concept of a machine with intelligence when the generalpurpose computer was made available widely to the public (Russel & Norvig, 2020, Copeland 2023). However, during that time, computers were not powerful enough to store a massive amount of data or process information quickly enough to communicate meaningfully with a person (Anhoya, 2020). The breakthrough in machine intelligence occurred in the 2010s, whereby scientists can run neural networks with many layers of artificial neurons that mimic neurons in the human brain, a system known as deep neural networks using a deep learning technique (Strickland, 2023). Since then, artificial machine technology has significantly progressed, enabling computer systems to understand, make decisions, and self-learn from human interaction, which surpasses human performance in many routine tasks (Russel & Norvig, 2020).
